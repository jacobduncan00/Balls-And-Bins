# Balls & Bins Goals

Still looking to add probability and counting aspects to it, but this is just a general visualization
Should be able to open the html file in a web browser and it should work out of the box, if not... then I'll
have to do a little bit of tweaking and see if I can figure out exactly how I installed matter-js and p5-js to make
this work

- [x] Create Canvas
- [x] Create Pegs
- [x] Create Balls
- [x] Spawn Balls from top
- [x] Add physics with matter-js
- [ ] Add boundaries to the world
- [ ] Count balls
- [ ] Create bin object where balls can be counted
- [ ] Count balls in bins
- [ ] Calculate probability and show equal likeliness
- [ ] Tweak probability if needed for it to be equally likely for a ball to land in each bin
- [ ] Plot graph of # of balls in each bin to the right of display
